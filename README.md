# Resc4You_Frontend
My final project, catering to citizens, volunteers, administrators, and representatives.
I enabled active submission of assistance requests and efficiently matched them with relevant volunteers based on specialization, availability, and location.
By implementing real-time updates, citizens could easily track their request status and the location of assigned volunteers.
I integrated push notifications for effective communication, ensuring volunteers were promptly notified of requests and citizens were informed upon volunteer acceptance.
Additionally, I incorporated a rating system for citizens to provide valuable feedback on volunteer service.
To foster collaboration, I included a chat feature for volunteers to communicate and ask questions within the system.
Web versions were created to facilitate efficient data management and provide comprehensive statistics for representatives and administrators.
React, React Native, ASP.NET, SQL Server, Firebase.

The env file should look like that: MAPS_API_KEY="" FIREBASE_API_KEY= "" AUTH_DOMAIN= "" DATABASE_URL= "" PROJECT_ID= "" STORAGE_BUCKET= "" 
MESSAGING_SENDER_ID= "" APP_ID= "" MEASUREMENT_ID= "" SERVICE_ID="" TEMPLATE_ID_VOLUNTEER="" TEMPLATE_ID_CITIZEN="" USER_ID=""
